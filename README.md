Based on what I can see. You arent with her just for the money. Nor do you not take this relationship seriously. You are disappointed that she isnt what you expected. You have to admit that despite all her flaws and what she has done. This is the person that you are in love with. You feel unhappy but yet you still hold on so tightly, not because you are a simp but you having feelings. And my advice is if you feel you deserved to be treated better, talk to her. If you talked to her, gave her chances, then its about time to syart asking yourself what you value more. Your feelings or hers.
